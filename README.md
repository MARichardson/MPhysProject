### MPhysProject

The aim of my project was to use observational data alongside a spectral fitting code to analyse the radial dependence of stellar population parameters
across multiple galaxies. The spectral fitting code used was FIREFLY which I was provided, I developed the code to include Marvin implementation, Marvin is
a python package created by those at MaNGA (telescope survey providing the data for the project) which provided tools for data visualisation and analysis.
I implemented it into FIREFLY which automated reading in the data. I also developed the wrapper script so results could be provided for the whole data set,
which allowed a full 2D map of properties to be produced meaning radial dependence could be analysed. For comparative purposes the original wrapper script 
was developed in the same way and run on the Sciama supercomputer (using slurm sbatch scripts).
